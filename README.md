## Project Description
As MSBA students, we were keen to explore the data science job market in the United States. The goal of this capstone project was to provide clear suggestions on what kind of skills and other requirements employers are looking for when hiring for data-related positions. At the same time, we collected data on future career choices, the range of salaries and possible promotions that we can expect after the graduation.

## Tools Used
R, Python, Tableau
